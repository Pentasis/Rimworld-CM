	<description>
		This mod brings the features of a whole lot of other mods together into one. I wrote it for myself because I was struggling to keep track of all the mods I subscribed to in an orderly manner.
		Where possible I will link and attribute the mods and their authors from which I got the idea's. I did however write it from scratch (although I admit to peeking at some code to see how they solved certain problems).
		Most, if not all, of this mod consists of small additions and changes to the vanilla game in order to make it more consistent or provide QoL.

		I have not done any extensive tests but I assume this mod is incompatible with the following mods. If for nothing else because it provides similar functionality.
